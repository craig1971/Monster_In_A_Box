# Monster In A Box
Arduino based controller for a Monster In A Box Halloween prop.

The idea is pretty simple: create the illusion that some type of container is holding a dangerous monster that is on the verge of escaping. The illusion can be created with any combination of motion, sound, light, smoke and, of course, surprise.
